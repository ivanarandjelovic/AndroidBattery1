- Log the range of 1 month or even more, if it prooves to be OK (from the "cpu time / mem space" perspective)
- Time of day is important
- Day of week is important
- Short range consumption might be very important if it is quite different then the average one for the current time of the day,
 in that case it must influence prediction more then usual
- Battery percents do not represent equal "bits" of battery power. We must take care of this.
  IDEA: Maybe we can gather average percent "duration" in separate table, over longer period (two weeks) it should provide relatively
  good idea about how "big" each percent is (at least compared with the others).
- Complete bat power must be calculated as summary of all 100 percent "bits" and then we deduct duration based on this (and
 all other influences, as history average, day of week average, short-term average, etc.)
